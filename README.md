## 🔹 Project Goal

* Learn and implement **Collaborative Filtering** concepts
* Build a recommendation system based on **user similarity**
* Work with real-world sparse data
* Practice **team collaboration** in machine learning projects

---

## 🔹 Features

* Create a **User–Item Matrix** from user rating data
* Compute user similarity using **Cosine Similarity**
* Initial implementation of **User-to-User Recommendation**
* Easily extendable to **Memory-Based, Model-Based, or Hybrid approaches**

## 🔹 How to Use

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

2. Place your data file at `data_set/rating_final.csv`
3. Run notebooks or scripts to compute user similarity and generate recommendations
